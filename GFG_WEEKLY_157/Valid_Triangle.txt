You are given three sticks of length a, b, c. You need to check whether it is possible to make a triangle with a positive area using these three sticks.

Return "YES" if it is possible else return "NO".

 string isPossible(int a, int b, int c) {
        // code here
        
        return (a<(b+c) && b<(a+c) && c<(b+a))?"YES":"NO";
    }
