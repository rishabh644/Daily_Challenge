You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

    int appendCharacters(string s, string t)
    {
        int i=0;
        int j=0;

        int m=s.size();
        int n=t.size();

        while(i<m && j<n)
        {
            if(s[i]==t[j])
            {
                j+=1;
            }

            i+=1;
        }

        return (n-j);
        
    }
